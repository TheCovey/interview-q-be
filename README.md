# API Documentation

#### Backend deployed at [Heroku](https://interview-q-staging.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

### Node.js + graphql-yoga + Prisma + Apollo Federation

We chose this framework for:

- Scalability: since the QualityHub project currently includes Core and InterviewQ (but will include future modules, like ResumeQ, etc.), we wanted to set up a gateway that would connect the different back-ends
- Simplicity: we wanted to set up a gateway so that the various front-end apps associated with the QualityHub project would only need to hit one endpoint
- Flexibility: we chose to implement GraphQL to make it easier for future front-end developers to access the backend schema

## Endpoints

#### Organization Routes & User Routes

## Actions

ðŸš« This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

<!-- `addUser(user object)` Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user -->

## Environment Variables
